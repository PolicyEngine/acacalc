    content: `The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created **premium tax credits** to help Americans afford health insurance purchased through the marketplace.

These credits work by capping how much of your income you're required to pay for a benchmark health plan—the **second-lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP)** in your area.

If the benchmark plan costs more than your required contribution, the government pays the difference as a tax credit.`,

    content: `The **American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)** of 2021 temporarily enhanced these subsidies. The **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)** of 2022 extended them through 2025.

Key changes:
- **Removed the 400% FPL ceiling**—credits now available at any income
- **Capped contributions at 8.5%** of income for everyone
- **Lowered contributions** at every income level

The chart shows how the IRA (blue) differs from the original ACA (gray).`,

Without congressional action, the subsidy structure will revert to the **original ACA rules**:
- The 400% FPL ceiling returns
- Required contributions increase
- Millions of households will see higher premiums or lose subsidies entirely

Notice how the gray baseline line ends at 400% FPL—the "subsidy cliff."`,

For our 45-year-old, this means Medicaid covers incomes up to about $22,000. Above that threshold, marketplace subsidies (PTCs) help cover premiums.`,
